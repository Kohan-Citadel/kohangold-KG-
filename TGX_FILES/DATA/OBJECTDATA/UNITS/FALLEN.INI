Description 		= The animated remains of a mortal, either exhumed by an aspiring necromancer or found strewn across one of the countless battlefields that scar the land. These restless creatures are cursed to wander Khaldun until they are destroyed either through decay, combat or the next great Cataclysm. They are driven by the single-minded desire to feed.
