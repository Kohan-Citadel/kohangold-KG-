Caring little for caution and planning, Sebastian runs headlong into life assuming that he'll be able to fight his way out of whatever problems he encounters. While not a traditional leader, Sebastian often inspires others to great feats of courage and physical strength. His flowing hair, bushy beard, and refusal to wear any sort of helmet, mark him on the battlefield for all to see. Sebastian's devotion to the Nationalist cause is outmatched only by his devotion to his wife Ahikar. It is said that when she tasted her first death, he fought through hundreds of vile beasts of the Shadow to reach her amulet before it could be spirited away. Now, he is rarely far from her side, having never forgiven himself for her death."	"A giant of a man, Sebastian Atafeh is a formidable opponent on the battlefield.
