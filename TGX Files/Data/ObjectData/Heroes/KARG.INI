Description         =   Never far from Amon Koth, Jhaengus serves as lieutenant and advisor to the progenitor of the Rhaksha. As a warrior, Jhaengus is ferocious and almost unstoppable, but as an advisor, his feral nature renders most of his advice unpalatable even to Amon Koth. No one outside of Amon Koth knows the true nature of Jhaengus, or who he was before his transformation into this hideous beast of carnage and death. One thing is known for sure, his loyalty to Amon Koth is unquestionable and his lust for blood unquenchable.
