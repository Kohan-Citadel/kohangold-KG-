Description         =   A crack shot with the bow and equally deadly with his sword, Aethan Farhyd is one of the Nationalists' fiercest warriors. Always dressed in black from head to toe, Aethan prefers to keep to himself, usually skulking in the shadows. If he is found with others, it is usually with his close companions and only friends, Sebastian Atafeh and Ahikar Iraj. If those two are found together, he is often not far behind. It has long been rumored that Aethan had feelings for Ahikar, but if that is true, he has kept those feelings hidden. ;'
