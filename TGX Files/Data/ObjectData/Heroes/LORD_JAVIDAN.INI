Description             =   His confidants know that when Lucius commits himself to something, he considers it an irrevokable pledge to give everything he can to make it happen. It is this trait that makes him a staunch ally and an implacable foe.  A angry scar cutting across his face, haunted sky-blue eyes, and grim nature conceal a man who was once handsome, jovial, and a leading member of the Council.  Lucius broke from the rest of House Ajam and joined the Royalist cause in the Sixth Age when his wife Lydian was killed and her amulet captured by the Ceyah. He became a tireless and bitter foe of the Ceyah, and to this day he searches for his wife's amulet. ;'
