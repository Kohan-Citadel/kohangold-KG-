Description                                                 =   Darya Azar is dedicated to two things in life, the eradication of the Ceyah and the Royalist cause. Because the two are often inextricably intertwined, she is single-minded in her focus, choosing to ignore everything else in her life. While attractive, her hair is often unkempt and her eyes often have the glint of a zealot on a mission. All her actions are filled with an unshakeable fervor and belief in her goal. She will do anything to accomplish her task, and only her devotion to the Royalist cause has kept her from being lumped in with the Nationalists.
