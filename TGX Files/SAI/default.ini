;
;       06/13/01 - IanK - Updated and reformatted; added Ahriman's Gift units
;	09/13/01 - IanK - CompanyFrontRepeatPenalty set to -5 as indicated in the comments
;	04/10/02 - IanK - Updated Default SAI Profile to improve performance of Medium and
;				Hard SAIs across the board.  The improvements are in unit
;				commissioning, bank account allocation, and goal priority
;				settings.  Also, the comments throughout the Default SAI
;				have been improved for easier comprehension
;	04/13/02 - IanK - Continued minor updates and tweaks
;	04/24/02 - IanK - Additional tweaks based on RickC's (Fenwe) feedback and internal testing
;
;       This file contains default values for all settings, and also includes a complete list

;       neutral on each of the player's think turns.  That is, it will be 95% of its
;       former value, since neutral is zero.
;       In parentheses following each number is the min and max values it can have.
;       These values are enforced.  If anything is set higher or lower, it is moved

chaotic                 =   0.1	; (0.0-0.5) random shift of opinion on each think turn.  0.5 would result in a random shift from -25% to +25%

;; City Templates
;;
;; Build templates are ignored in default.ini, but can be specified for each
;; individual SAI. They tell the AI to try to construct componnets and upgrades
;; in a settlement in a specific way.
;;
;; Number of templates: there is no restriction
;;
;; Number of components/upgrades: there is no restriction.  Specifying an upgrade
;;   automatically requires the basic component (i.e. you only need "CarpentryGuild").
;;   You can specify more than 7, and you can specify more than one upgrade for a
;;   base component;  it will be impossible to satisfy, but the AI will bonus each.
;;
;; Filters: MinEconomy, MaxEconomy, MinCities, MaxCities, Race, OnlyFaction, ExceptFaction
;;   are all filters or pre-requisites for the AI to consider a particular settlement
;;   as a candidate for the template. Min/MaxCities refers to the total number of
;;   settlements owned by the player.
;;
;; MaxInstances: specifying a value greater than 1 tells the AI to try to assign
;;   this template to multiple buildings.  Not to be confused with Min/MaxCities.
;;
;; Bonus: this is the bonus priority applied to each matching component or upgrade.
;;   The AI still applies other logic to take into account the state of its economy.
;;
;; The specific fields are as follows.
;;
;; [BuildTemplates]
